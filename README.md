## The Fork Task

- This framework is about Frontend and API Automation Testing, and it supports Page Object Model design pattern

- Tools:
  - Selenium 4.5.0 to automate web browser
  - TestNG Framework,
  - Java to write scripts 
  - TestNG 7.5 for assertions
  - Webdrivermanager 5.3.0 to get current driver for selenium
  - Log4j 1.2.17 to write logs
  - Maven for build management tool
  - RestAssured 5.2.0 for API automation
  - Gson 2.9.0 for de-serialization
  
- For programming language Java is used to write scripts and OOP principles are implemented in the framework.

- Log4j is used to record logs and logs are displayed in the "loggile.log" file.

- Test report is generated by maven-surefire-reports and is displayed in the "index.html" file (target/surefire-reports/index.html)

- After cloning the project, you can use this scripts to execute tests:
    - For Test1 class : mvn test -Dtest="Test1"
    - For Test2 class : mvn test -Dtest="Test2"
    - For Test3_PokeAPI class : mvn test -Dtest="Test3_PokeAPI"

- Test1 class handles reCAPTCHA partially. When meet image-based captcha, this fails.
- Test2 class handles reCAPTCHA by adding previous cookies to current session.
- Test3_PokeAPI class is related to API testing automation
- When a test fails, it re-runs once automatically.
